                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>Band drilling has many advantages over traditional seed drills, one of the keystones is reducing soil
                    disturbance and empowering nature to do its job – keeping it fields alive.
                    Regenerative farming is not just a cool trend, it is a fascinating journey allowing farmers to
                    benefit themselves while diminishing erosion and enriching their prime tool – soil.
                    Laumetris strip tilling concept is designed to accomplish top priority goals for well-prepared
                    seeding:
                    cultivating soil only where it is needed while keeping most of it undisturbed, spreading mineral
                    fertilizers and spraying starting liquid fertilizers,
                    developing great seedbed and finishing with high precision drilling. And all these operations
                    proceed in a single go directly into stubble just after you finished harvesting,
                    fitting into complex agriculture seeding terms.

                    <h3>Strip till drilling combines the best attributes of both no tillage and conventional tillage
                        technologies</h3>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        1) Stubble is the best protection against erosion, as well topsoil protection highly reduces
                        moisture evaporation, prevents weeds growing.
                        Stubble also helps to linger snow during winter – better probability to withstand cold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2) Soil is being tilled only at the seeding zone and narrow strip beneath it – the rest is
                        untilled keeping soil structure unbroken.
                        Low disturbance keeps soil aggregates intact, which benefits better water infiltration,
                        maintains organic matter, keeps mycorrhizal fungal networks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3) Earthworms are a sign of a healthy soil. It helps to convert old stubble to nutrients for
                        freshly sprouted plants and improves soil fertility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4) Laumetris RS and RSL drills prepare seedbeds in the best conditions for rapid germination.
                        One of the key factors is bringing moisture to topsoil from beneath.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tech-description-second-column">
                    <p>
                        5) Mineral fertilizers are distributed throughout 5-15 cm of depth. 2/3 clients using Laumetris
                        strip till drills combined together with mineral (BF) and liquid (LF) fertilization systems.
                        Spraying of start-up liquid fertilizers adds up to rapid sprouting, mineral fertilizers are
                        being consumed at a later stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6) Strip till technology enables farmers to reduce seeding rate as plants receive more sun, have
                        less competition, better conditions to sprout, grow, have more side branches, stronger stems,
                        are
                        healthier and harvest results at the end stay the same or even increased. Comparing how many
                        tillage processes are dropped, fuel and time saved – strip till technology highly increases
                        profitability of the farm.
                        CO2 emissions are reduced as a consequence of using strip till.

                    <p>
                        1) Front cutting disc cuts soil surface and removes residues – opens a band for further
                        processes. Rubber suspension is used as a protection against obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2) Working tine loosens soils up to 30 cm depth and brings moisture soil upwards. Moisture adds
                        to a quicker germination. Every tine is equipped with wear points with added carbide tiles –
                        improved longevity.
                        Also, every tine has an attached hydraulic cylinder which works as protection – pressure can be
                        adjusted according to working conditions. In addition, tines can be pulled upwards for a quick
                        straws cleaning in case of clogging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3) Mineral fertilizers are spread throughout 5-15 cm of depth due to a specific outflow
                        positioning. Liquid fertilizers are sprayed on top of a strip just before the compaction.
                        Liquid fertilizers have much better absorption rate compared to mineral fertilizers and its
                        addition to fields vastly increase speed of germination. Mineral and liquid fertilizer are only
                        spread in a working strip, precisely where it is needed to be.
                        In general, lower fertilizers consumption does not reduce yields but greatly increases
                        profitability as the end results are the same.
                    </p>

                <div class="tech-description-second-column">
                    <p>
                        4) Various type of rollers allows for optimal strip compaction and seedbed preparation. “U” type
                        roller goes best in light soils, disc type – heavy and clayish fields, wheels roller fits best
                        in universal conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5) For 25 years Austrian company “APV” has been manufacturing top quality seeding units which we
                        believe are the best in the market. For this reason, we implement their production which are
                        very reliable, easy to control, calibrate and trustworthy.
                        Our main task is to solve the precise rapeseed placement which we do with high quality two-disc
                        system held at a certain angle, therefore inside of discs never gets clogged. Depth is
                        controlled through changing position of the pressing wheel.
                        Every strip seeding unit has own rubber protection against stones. The whole seeding section is
                        equipped with a few hydraulic cylinders which help to maintain pressure to assure top quality
                        seed drilling in all type conditions.
                        In universal RS drills we use tine seed placement which is technologically better for wheat seed
                        placement as it seeds in bands of 15 cm width.

                <p>Higher temperature is a very important factor for faster plants emergence and crop development in
                    spring seeding. This is usually followed with higher crop yields and quality. Another important
                    factor of quick germination is appropriate amount of moisture in fields.
                    Residues left on the soil helps to keep snow and store rainwater. Snow helps plants to withstand
                    cold winter and reduce potential plants freeze damaging. Strip till technology provides benefits of
                    both no till and conventional till technologies: faster heat absorption, better wintering conditions
                    and kept moisture for quick spring plant emergence, future development.
                    When strip tilling in between bands are left with old crop residues (preserved moisture and lower
                    evaporation) and strips with plants absorbs more heat <a
